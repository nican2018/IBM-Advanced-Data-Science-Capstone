Building a Value Prediction system

According to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with you if you provide personalized service. The bank is no exception.

Digitization of everyday life means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner, and often before they even realize they need them. In its 3rd Kaggle competition, the Santander Group aims to go beyond recognizing the need to provide a financial service to a client and intends to determine the amount or the value of the client's transaction. It means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many financial services choices, this need is more important than ever. [Banco Santander]

In this book, we are building a prediction system to help identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. It is a first step that Santander must nail down to personalize its services on a large scale.
